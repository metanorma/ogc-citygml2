This document is an OGC Encoding Standard for the representation, storage and
exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape models. CityGML is implemented as an
application schema of the Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3).

CityGML models both complex and georeferenced 3D vector data along with the
semantics associated with the data. In contrast to other 3D vector formats,
CityGML is based on a rich, general purpose information model in addition to
geometry and appearance information. For specific domain areas, CityGML also
provides an extension mechanism to enrich the data with identifiable features
under preservation of semantic interoperability.

Targeted application areas explicitly include urban and landscape planning;
architectural design; tourist and leisure activities; 3D cadastres;
environmental simulations; mobile telecommunications; disaster management;
homeland security; vehicle and pedestrian navigation; training simulators and
mobile robotics.

CityGML is considered a source format for 3D portraying. The semantic
information contained in the model can be used in the styling process which
generates computer graphics represented e.g. as KML/COLLADA or X3D files. The
appropriate OGC Portrayal Web Service for this process is the OGC Web 3D Service
(W3DS). An image-based 3D portrayal service for virtual 3D landscape and city
models is provided by the OGC Web View Service (WVS).

Features of CityGML:

* Geospatial information model (ontology) for urban landscapes based on the ISO
191xx family

* GML3 representation of 3D geometries, based on the ISO 19107 model

* Representation of object surface characteristics (e.g. textures, materials)

* Taxonomies and aggregations

** Digital Terrain Models as a combination of (including nested) triangulated
irregular networks (TINs), regular rasters, break and skeleton lines, mass
points

** Sites (currently buildings, bridges, and tunnels)

** Vegetation (areas, volumes, and solitary objects with vegetation
classification)

** Water bodies (volumes, surfaces)

** Transportation facilities (both graph structures and 3D surface data)

** Land use (representation of areas of the earth's surface dedicated to a
specific land use)

** City furniture

** Generic city objects and attributes

** User-definable (recursive) grouping

* Multiscale model with 5 well-defined consecutive Levels of Detail (LOD):
** LOD0 -- regional, landscape
** LOD1 -- city, region
** LOD2 -- city districts, projects
** LOD3 -- architectural models (outside), landmarks
** LOD4 -- architectural models (interior)

* Multiple representations in different LODs simultaneously; generalisation
relations between objects in different LODs

* Optional topological connections between feature (sub)geometries

* Application Domain Extensions (ADE): Specific "hooks" in the CityGML schema
allow to define application specific extensions, for example for noise pollution
simulation, or to augment CityGML by properties of the new National Building
Information Model Standard (NBIMS) in the U.S.
