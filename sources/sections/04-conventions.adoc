=== UML Notation

The CityGML standard is presented in this document in diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagram (see Booch et al. 1997). The UML notations used in this standard are described in the diagram below (<<fig_1>>).

According to GML3 all associations between model elements in CityGML are uni-directional. Thus, associations in CityGML are navigable in only one direction. The direction of navigation is depicted by an arrowhead. In general, the context an element takes within the association is indicated by its role. The role is displayed near the target of the association. If the graphical representation is ambiguous though, the position of the role has to be drawn to the element the association points to.


The following stereotypes are used:

\<<Geometry>> represents the geometry of an object. The geometry is an identifiable and distinguishable object that is derived from the abstract GML type _AbstractGeometryType_.

\<<Feature>> represents a thematic feature according to the definition in ISO 19109. A feature is an identifiable and distinguishable object that is derived from the abstract GML type _AbstractFeatureType_.

\<<Object>> represents an identifiable and distinguishable object that is derived from the abstract GML type _AbstractGMLType_.

\<<Enumeration>> enumerates the valid attribute values in a fixed list of named literal values. Enumerations are specified inline the CityGML schema.

\<<CodeList>> enumerates the valid attribute values. In contrast to Enumeration, the list of values is open and, thus, not given inline the CityGML schema. The allowed values can be provided within an external code list. It is recommended that code lists are implemented as simple dictionaries following the GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary Profile (cf. <<scls_6-6>> and <<scls_10-14>>).

\<<Union>> is a list of attributes. The semantics are that only one of the attributes can be present at any time.

\<<PrimitiveType>> is used for representations supported by a primitive type in the implementation.

\<<DataType>> is used as a descriptor of a set of values that lack identity. Data types include primitive predefined types and user-definable types. A DataType is thus a class with few or no operations whose primary purpose is to hold the abstract state of another class for transmittal, storage, encoding or persistent storage.

\<<Leaf>> is used within UML package diagrams to indicate model elements that can have no further subtypes.

\<<XSDSchema>> is used within UML package diagrams to denote the root element of an XSD Schema containing all the definitions for a particular namespace. All the package contents or component classes are placed within the one schema.

\<<ApplicationSchema>> is used within UML package diagrams to denote an XML Schema definition fundamentally dependent on the concepts of another independent Standard within the XML Schema metalanguage. For example, ApplicationSchema indicates extensions of GML consistent with the GML "rules for application schemas".

In order to enhance the readability of the CityGML UML diagrams, classes are depicted in different colors if they belong to different UML packages (see <<fig_8>> for an overview of UML packages). The following coloring scheme is applied:

* Classes painted in yellow belong to the UML package which is subject of discussion in that clause of the specification in which the UML diagram is given. For example, in the context of <<scls_10-1>> which introduces the _CityGML Core_ module, the yellow color is used to denote classes which are defined in the _CityGML Core_ UML package. Likewise, the yellow classes shown in UML diagrams in <<scls_10-3>> are associated with the _Building_ module which is subject of discussion in that chapter.
* Classes painted in blue belong to a CityGML UML package different to that associated with the yellow color. In order to explicitly denote the UML package of such classes, their class names carry a namespace prefix which is uniquely associated with a CityGML module throughout this specification (cf. section 4.3 for a list of namespaces and prefixes). For example, in the context of the _Building_ module, classes from the _CityGML Core_ module are painted in blue and their class names are preceded by the prefix _core_.
* Classes painted in green are defined in GML3 and their class names are preceded by the prefix _gml_.


The following example UML diagram demonstrates the UML notation and coloring scheme used throughout this specification. In this example, the yellow classes are associated with the CityGML _Building_ module, the blue classes are from the _CityGML Core_ module, and the green class depicts a geometry element defined by GML3.

[[scls_4-3]]
=== XML namespaces and namespace prefixes

The CityGML data model is thematically decomposed into a core module and thematic extension modules. All modules including the core are specified by their own XML schema file, each defining a globally unique XML namespace. The extension modules are based on the core module and, thus, contain (by reference) the CityGML core schema.

Within this document the module namespaces are associated with recommended prefixes. These prefixes are consistently used within the normative parts of this specification, for all UML diagrams and example CityGML instance documents. The CityGML core and extension modules along with their XML namespace identifiers and recommended namespace prefixes are listed in <<tab_1>>.

=== XML-Schema

The normative parts of the standard use the W3C XML schema language to describe the grammar of conformant CityGML data instances. XML schema is a rich language with many capabilities. While a reader who is unfamiliar with an XML schema may be able to follow the description in a general fashion, this standard is not intended to serve as an introduction to XML schema. In order to have a full understanding of this candidate standard, it is necessary for the reader to have a reasonable knowledge of XML schema.
