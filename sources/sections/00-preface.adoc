== Abstract

CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.

The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the reuse of the same data in different application fields.

Significant changes between CityGML version 2.0.0 and CityGML version 1.0.0 (OGC
document no. 08-007r1):

* New thematic modules for the representation of tunnels and bridges;

* Additional boundary surfaces for the semantic classification of the outer
shell of buildings and building parts (_OuterCeilingSurface_ and
_OuterFloorSurface_);

* LOD0 representation (footprint and roof egde representations) for buildings
and building parts;

* Additional attributes denoting a city object's location with respect to the
surrounding terrain and water surface (_relativeToTerrain_ and
_relativeToWater_);

* Additional generic attributes for measured values and attribute sets; and

* Redesign of the CityGML code list mechanism (enumerative attributes are now of
type _gml:CodeType_ which facilitates to provide additional code lists
enumerating their possible attribute values).

Migration of existing CityGML 1.0 instances to valid 2.0 instances only requires
changing the CityGML namespace and schema location values in the document to the
actual 2.0 values.

== Introduction

=== Motivation

An increasing number of cities and companies are building virtual 3D city models
for different application areas like urban planning, mobile telecommunication,
disaster management, 3D cadastre, tourism, vehicle and pedestrian navigation,
facility management and environmental simulations. Furthermore, in the
implementation of the European Environmental Noise Directive (
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/noise/home.htm[END, 2002/49/EC]) 3D
geoinformation and 3D city models play an important role.

In recent years, most virtual 3D city models have been defined as purely
graphical or geometrical models, neglecting the semantic and topological
aspects. Thus, these models could almost only be used for visualisation purposes
but not for thematic queries, analysis tasks, or spatial data mining. Since the
limited reusability of models inhibits the broader use of 3D city models, a more
general modelling approach had to be taken in order to satisfy the information
needs of the various application fields.

CityGML is a common semantic information model for the representation of 3D
urban objects that can be shared over different applications. The latter
capability is especially important with respect to the cost-effective
sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing the possibility of selling
the same data to customers from different application fields. The targeted
application areas explicitly include city planning, architectural design,
tourist and leisure activities, environmental simulation, mobile
telecommunication, disaster management, homeland security, real estate
management, vehicle and pedestrian navigation, and training simulators.

CityGML is designed as an open data model and XML-based format for the storage
and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is implemented as an application
schema of the Geography Markup Language 3 (GML3), the extendible international
standard for spatial data exchange and encoding issued by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. CityGML is based on a number of standards
from the ISO 191xx family, the Open Geospatial Consortium, the W3C Consortium,
the Web 3D Consortium, and OASIS.

CityGML defines the classes and relations for the most relevant topographic
objects in cities and regional models with respect to their geometrical,
topological, semantical, and appearance properties. "City" is broadly defined to
comprise not just built structures, but also elevation, vegetation, water
bodies, "city furniture", and more. Included are generalisation hierarchies
between thematic classes, aggregations, relations between objects, and spatial
properties. CityGML is applicable for large areas and small regions and can
represent the terrain and 3D objects in different levels of detail
simultaneously. Since either simple, single scale models without topology and
few semantics or very complex multi-scale models with full topology and
fine-grained semantical differentiations can be represented, CityGML enables
lossless information exchange between different GI systems and users.


[[scls_0-2]]
=== Historical background

CityGML has been developed since 2002 by the members of the Special Interest
Group 3D ( http://www.sig3d.org/[SIG 3D]). Since 2010, this group is part of the
initiative Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany (GDI-DE). Before 2010, the SIG 3D
was affiliated to the initiative Geodata Infrastructure North Rhine-Westphalia
(GDI NRW). The SIG 3D is an open group consisting of more than 70 companies,
municipalities, and research institutions from Germany, Great Britain,
Switzerland, and Austria working on the development and commercial exploitation
of interoperable 3D city models and geovisualisation. Another result of the work
from the SIG 3D is the proposition of the Web 3D Service (W3DS), a 3D portrayal
service that is also being discussed in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC Doc.
No. 05-019 and OGC Doc. No. 09-104r1).

A first successful implementation and evaluation of a subset of CityGML has been
performed in the project "Pilot 3D" of the GDI NRW in 2005. Participants came
from all over Germany and demonstrated city planning scenarios and tourist
applications. By the beginning of 2006, a CityGML project within EuroSDR (
http://www.eurosdr.net/[European Spatial Data Research]) started focusing on the
European harmonisation of 3D city modelling. From June to December 2006, CityGML
was employed and evaluated in the CAD/GIS/BIM thread of the OpenGIS Web Services
Testbed #4 (OWS-4). Since 2008, CityGML (version 1.0.0) is an adopted OGC
standard.

From that point in time, CityGML has disseminated worldwide. Many cities in
Germany and in other countries in Europe provide their 3D city model in CityGML
(Berlin, Cologne, Dresden and Munich, to mention only a few). In France, the
project Bâti3D (IGN France) defines a profile of CityGML LOD2 and provides data
from Paris and the city centres of Aix-en-Provence, Lille, Nantes and Marseille.
CityGML also plays an important role in the pilot 3D project to obtain a 3D
geoinformation standard and a 3D infrastructure for The Netherlands. Many cities
in Europe like Monaco, Geneva, Zurich, Leewarden use CityGML LOD 2 or 3 to
represent and exchange data, as well as cities in Denmark (LOD 2 and 3, partly
LOD4). CityGML has strongly influenced the building model (version 2.0) of the
INSPIRE initiative of the EU commission, which aims at the creation of an
European spatial data infrastructure providing public sector data in an
interoperable way. In Asia, the 3D city models of Istanbul (LOD 1 and 2), Doha,
Katar (LOD3), and Yokohama (LOD2) are represented and exchanged in CityGML.
Moreover, CityGML plays a crucial role for the 3D Spatial data infrastructure in
Malaysia.

Today many commercial and academic tools support CityGML by providing import
interfaces, export interfaces or both. An example is the 3D City Database which
is a free and open source 3D geo database to store, represent, and manage
virtual 3D city models on top of Oracle 10g R2 and 11g R1/R2 provided by the
Technische Universität Berlin. It fully supports CityGML and is shipped with a
tool for the import and export of CityGML models. Furthermore, an open source
Java class library and API for the processing of CityGML models (citygml4j) is
provided by the Technische Universität Berlin. The conversion tool FME (Feature
Manipulation Engine) from Safe Software Inc., which is part of the
interoperability extension of ESRI's ArcGIS, has read and write interfaces for
CityGML. The same applies to CAD tools as BentleyMap from Bentley Systems as
well as to GIS tools like SupportGIS from CPA Geo-Information. Many 3D viewers
(which all are freely available) provide read interfaces for CityGML: the
Aristoteles Viewer from the University of Bonn, LandXplorer CityGML Viewer from
Autodesk Inc. (the studio version for authoring and management is not free) and
the FZKViewer for IFC and CityGML from KIT Karlsruhe and BS Contact from
Bitmanagement Software GmbH which offers a CityGML plugin for the geospatial
extension BS Contact Geo. This enumeration of software tools is not exhaustive
and steadily growing. Please refer to the official website of CityGML at
http://www.citygml.org/[http://www.citygml.org] as well as the CityGML Wiki at
http://www.citygmlwiki.org/[http://www.citygmlwiki.org] for more information.


[[scls_0-3]]
=== Additions in CityGML 2.0

CityGML 2.0 is a major revision of the previous version 1.0 of this
International Standard (OGC Doc. No. 08-007r1), and introduces substantial
additions and new features to the thematic model of CityGML. The revision was
originally planned to be a minor update to version 1.1. The main endeavor of the
revision process was to ensure backwards compatibility both on the level of the
conceptual model and on the level of CityGML instance documents. However, some
changes could not be implemented consistent with directives for minor revisions
and backwards compatibility as enforced by OGC policy (cf. OGC Doc. No. 135r11).
The major version number change to 2.0 is therefore a consequence of conforming
to the OGC versioning policy without having to abandon any changes or additions
which reflect requests from the CityGML community.

CityGML 2.0 is backwards compatible with version 1.0 in the following sense:
each valid 1.0 instance is a valid 2.0 instance provided that the CityGML
namespaces and schema locations in the document are changed to their actual 2.0
values. This step is required because the CityGML version number is encoded in
these values, but no further actions have to be taken. Hence, there is a simple
migration path from existing CityGML 1.0 instances to valid 2.0 instances.

The following clauses provide an overview of what is new in CityGML 2.0.


==== New thematic modules for the representation of bridges and tunnels

Bridges and tunnels are important objects in city and landscape models. They are
an essential part of the transportation infrastructure and are often easily
recognizable landmarks of a city. CityGML 1.0 has been lacking thematic modules
dedicated to bridges and tunnels, and thus such objects had to be modelled and
exchanged using a _GenericCityObject_ as proxy (cf. <<scls_10-12>>). CityGML 2.0
now introduces two new thematic modules for the explicit representation of
bridges and tunnels which complement the thematic model of CityGML: the _Bridge_
module (cf. <<scls_10-4>>) and the _Tunnel_ module (cf. <<scls_10-5>>).

Bridges and tunnels can be represented in LOD 1 - 4 and the underlying data
models have a coherent structure with the _Building_ model. For example, bridges
and tunnels can be decomposed into parts, thematic boundary surfaces with
openings are available to semantically classify parts of the shell, and
installations as well as interior built structures can be represented. This
coherent model structure facilitates the similar understanding of semantic
entities and helps to reduce software implementation efforts. Both the _Bridge_
and the _Tunnel_ model introduce further concepts and model elements which are
specific to bridges and tunnels respectively.


==== Additions to existing thematic modules

* _CityGML Core module (cf. <<scls_10-1>>)_ +
Two new optional attributes have been added to the abstract base class
_core:_CityObject_ within the _CityGML Core_ module: _relativeToTerrain_ and
_relativeToWater._ These attributesdenote the feature's location with respect to
the terrain and water surface in a qualitative way, and thus facilitate simple
and efficient queries (e.g., for the number of subsurface buildings) without the
need for an additional digital terrain model or a model of the water body.


* _Building module (cf. <<scls_10-3>>)_

** _LOD0 representation_ +
Buildings can now be represented in LOD0 by footprint and/or roof edge polygons.
This allows the easy integration of existing 2D data and of roof reconstructions
from aerial and satellite imagery into a 3D city model. The representations are
restricted to horizontal, 3-dimensional surfaces.

** _Additional thematic boundary surfaces_ +
In order to semantically classify parts of the outer building shell which are
neither horizontal wall surfaces nor parts of the roof, two additional boundary
surfaces are introduced: +
_OuterFloorSurface_ and _OuterCeilingSurface_.

** _Additional relations to thematic boundary surfaces_ +
In addition to &#95;__AbstractBuilding__ and _Room_, the surface geometries of
_BuildingInstallation_ and _IntBuildingInstallation_ features can now be
semantically classified using thematic boundary surfaces. For example, this
facilitates the semantic differentiation between roof and wall surfaces of
dormers which are modeled as _BuildingInstallation_.

** _Additional use of implicit geometries_ +
Implicit geometries (cf. <<scls_8-3>>) are now available for the representation
of __Opening_, _BuildingInstallation_, and _IntBuildingInstallation_ in addition
to _BuildingFurniture_. A prototypical geometry for these city objects can thus
be stored once and instantiated at different locations in the 3D city model.

* _Generics module (cf. <<scls_10-12>>)_ +
Two generic attributes have been added to the _Generics_ module: _MeasureAttribute_ and +
_GenericAttributeSet_. A _MeasureAttribute_ facilitates the representation of
measured values together with a reference to the employed unit. A
_GenericAttributeSet_&nbsp;is a named collection of arbitrary generic
attributes. It provides an optional _codeSpace_ attribute to denote the
authority organization who defined the attribute set.

* _LandUse module (cf. <<scls_10-10>>)_ +
The scope of the feature type _LandUse_ has been broadened to comprise both
areas of the earth's surface dedicated to a specific land use and areas of the
earth's surface having a specific land cover with or without vegetation.

* _Attributes_ class, function, _and_ usage _(all modules)_ +
In order to harmonize the use of the attributes _class_, _function_, and
_usage_, this attribute triplet has been complemented for all feature classes
that at least provided one of the attributes in CityGML 1.0.


==== Additions to the CityGML code list mechanism

In CityGML, code lists providing the allowed values for enumerative attributes
such as _class_, _function_, and _usage_ can be specified outside the CityGML
schema by any organization or information community according to their specific
information needs. This mechanism is, however, not fully reflected in the
CityGML 1.0 encoding schema, because in a CityGML 1.0 instance document a
corresponding attribute cannot point to the dictionary with the used code list
values. This has been corrected for CityGML 2.0: All attributes taking values
from code lists are now of type _gml:CodeType_ following the GML 3.1.1 mechanism
for the encoding of code list values (cf. <<scls_10-14>> for more information).
The _gml:CodeType_ adds an optional _codeSpace_ value to enumerative attributes
which allows for providing a persistent URI pointing to the corresponding
dictionary.


==== Changelog for CityGML 2.0

Changes on the level of XML schema components are provided in <<annex_f>>.


==== Further edits to the specification document

* _Accuracy requirements for Levels of Detail (LOD) (cf. <<scls_6-2>>)_ +
The accuracy requirements for the different CityGML LODs proposed in
<<scls_6-2>> are non-normative. The wording of <<scls_6-2>> in CityGML 1.0 is
however inconsistent with regard to this fact and thus has been clarified for
CityGML 2.0.

* _Rework of the CityGML example datasets (cf. <<annex_g>>)_ +
The CityGML examples provided in <<annex_g>> have been reworked and extended.
They now show a consistent building model in all five LODs and demonstrate, for
example, the semantic and geometric refinement of the building throughout the
different LODs as well as the usage of XLinks to share geometry elements between
features. The datasets are shipped with the CityGML XML Schema package, and are
available at
http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/examples/2.0/[http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/examples/2.0/].

* _New example for the usage of Application Domain Extensions (cf. <<annex_i>>)_ +
A second example for the usage of Application Domain Extensions in the field of
Ubiquitous Network Robots Services has been added in <<annex_i>>.
