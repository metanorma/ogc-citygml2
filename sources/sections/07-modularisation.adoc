== Modularisation

CityGML is a rich standard both on the thematic and geometric-topological level of its data model. On its thematic level CityGML defines classes and relations for the most relevant topographic objects in cities and regional models comprising built structures, elevation, vegetation, water bodies, city furniture, and more. In addition to geometry and appearance content these thematic components allow to employ virtual 3D city models for sophisticated analysis tasks in different application domains like simulations, urban data mining, facility management, and thematic inquiries.

CityGML is to be seen as a framework giving geospatial 3D data enough space to grow in geometrical, topological and semantic aspects over its lifetime. Thus, geometry and semantics of city objects may be flexibly structured covering purely geometric datasets up to complex geometric-topologically sound and spatio-semantically coherent data. By this means, CityGML defines a single object model and data exchange format applicable to consecutive process steps of 3D city modelling from geometry acquisition, data qualification and refinement to preparation of data for specific end-user applications, allowing for iterative data enrichment and lossless information exchange (cf. Kolbe et al. 2009).

According to this idea of a framework, applications are not required to support all thematic fields of CityGML in order to be compliant to the standard, but may employ a subset of constructs corresponding to specific relevant requirements of an application domain or process step. The use of logical subsets of CityGML limits the complexity of the overall data model and explicitly allows for valid partial implementations. As for version 2.0 of the CityGML standard, possible subsets of the data model are defined and embraced by so called CityGML modules. A CityGML module is an aggregate of normative aspects that must all be implemented as a whole by a conformant system. CityGML consists of a core module and thematic extension modules.

The CityGML core module defines the basic concepts and components of the CityGML data model. It is to be seen as the universal lower bound of the overall CityGML data model and a dependency of all thematic extension modules. Thus, the core module is unique and must be implemented by any conformant system. Based on the CityGML core module, each extension module contains a logically separate thematic component of the CityGML data model. The extensions to the core are derived by vertically slicing the overall CityGML data model. Since the core module is contained (by reference) in each extension module, its general concepts and components are universal to all extension modules. The following thirteen thematic extension modules are introduced by version 2.0 of the CityGML standard. They are directly related to clauses of this document each covering the corresponding thematic field of CityGML:

* Appearance (cf. <<cls_9>>),
* Bridge (cf. <<scls_10-5>>)
* Building (cf. <<scls_10-3>>),
* CityFurniture (cf. <<scls_10-9>>),
* CityObjectGroup (cf. <<scls_10-11>>),
* Generics (cf. <<scls_10-12>>),
* LandUse (cf. <<scls_10-10>>),
* Relief (cf. <<scls_10-2>>),
* Transportation (cf. <<scls_10-7>>),
* Tunnel (cf. <<scls_10-4>>)
* Vegetation (cf. <<scls_10-8>>), 
* WaterBody (cf. <<scls_10-6>>), and
* TexturedSurface [deprecated] (cf. <<scls_9-8>>).

The thematic decomposition of the CityGML data model allows for implementations to support any combination of extension modules in conjunction with the core module in order to be CityGML conformant. Thus, the extension modules may be arbitrarily combined according to the information needs of an application or application domain. A combination of modules is called a CityGML profile. The union of all modules is defined as the CityGML _base profile_. The base profile is unique at any given time and forms the upper bound of the overall CityGML data model. Any other CityGML profile must be a valid subset of the base profile. By following the concept of CityGML modules and profiles, valid partial implementations of the CityGML data model may be realised in a well-defined way.

As for future development, each CityGML module may be further developed independently from other modules by expert groups and information communities. Resulting proposals and changes to modules may be introduced into future revisions of the CityGML standard without affecting the validity of other modules. Furthermore, thematic components not covered by the current CityGML data model may be added to future revisions of the standard by additional thematic extension modules. These additional extensions may establish dependency relations to any other existing CityGML module but shall at least be dependent on the CityGML core module. Consequently, the CityGML base profile may vary over time as new extensions are added. However, if a specific application has information needs to be modelled and exchanged which are beyond the scope of the CityGML data model, this application data can also be incorporated within the existing modules using CityGML's _Application Domain Extension_ mechanism (cf. <<scls_10-13>>) or by employing the concepts of generic city objects and attributes (cf. <<scls_10-12>>).

The introduced modularisation approach supports CityGML's versatility as a data modelling framework and exchange format addressing various application domains and different steps of 3D city modelling. For sake of clarity, applications should announce the level of conformance to the CityGML standard by declaring the employed CityGML profile. Since the core module is part of all profiles, this should be realised by enumerating the implemented thematic extension modules. For example, if an implementation supports the _Building_ module, the _Relief_ module, and the _Vegetation_ module in addition to the core, this should be announced by "CityGML [Building, Relief, Vegetation]". In case the base profile is supported, this should be indicated by "CityGML [full]".

=== CityGML core and extension modules

Each CityGML module is specified by its own XML Schema definition file and is defined within an individual and globally unique XML target namespace. According to dependency relations between modules, each module may, in addition, import namespaces associated to such related CityGML modules. However, a single namespace shall not be directly included in two modules. Thus, all elements belonging to one module are associated to the module's namespace only. By this means, module elements are guaranteed to be properly separated and distinguishable in CityGML instance documents.

Compared to CityGML versions before 1.0, the aforementioned namespace conventions introduce an extra level of complexity to data files as there is no single CityGML namespace any more. In contrast, components of different CityGML modules and, thus, of different namespaces may be arbitrarily mixed within the same CityGML instance document. Furthermore, an application might have to parse instance documents containing elements of modules which are not employed by the application itself. These parsing problems though can easily be overcome by non-"schema-aware" applications, i.e. applications that do not parse and interpret GML application schemas in a generic way. Elements from different namespaces than those declared by the application's employed CityGML profile could be skipped. Comparable observations have to be made when using CityGML's Application Domain Extension mechanism (cf. <<scls_10-13>>).

As for version 2.0 of the CityGML standard, there are no two thematic extension modules related by dependency. Thus, all extension modules are truly independent from each other and may be separately supported by implementations. However, the CityGML core module is a dependency for any extension module. This means that the XML schema file of the core module is imported by each XML schema file defining an extension.

The dependency relations between CityGML's modules are illustrated in <<fig_8>> using an UML package diagram. Each module is represented by a package. The package names correspond to the module names. A dashed arrow in the figure indicates that the schema at the tail of the arrow depends upon the schema at the head of the arrow. For CityGML modules, a dependency occurs where one schema &lt;import&gt;s another schema and accordingly the corresponding XML namespace. For example, the extension module _Building_ imports the schema of the _CityGML Core_ module. A short description of each module is given in <<tab_4>>.

Each extension module (indicated by the leaf packages) further imports the GML 3.1.1 schema definition in order to represent spatial properties of its thematic classes. For readability reasons, the corresponding dependencies have been omitted.

.Overview of CityGML's core and thematic extensions modules.
[width=768]
|===
| *Module name* | CityGML Core
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | cityGMLBase.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | core
| *Module description* a| The _CityGML Core_ module defines the basic components of the CityGML data model. Primarily, this comprises abstract base classes from which all thematic classes are (transitively) derived. But also non-abstract content common to more than one extension module, for example basic data types, is defined within the core module.

The core module itself imports the XML schema definition files of GML version 3.1.1 and the OASIS extensible Address Language xAL.

| |

| *Module name* | Appearance
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/appearance/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | appearance.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | app
| *Module description* | The _Appearance_ module provides the means to model appearances of CityGML features, i.e. observable properties of the feature's surface. Appearance data may be stored for each city object. Therefore, the abstract base class __CityObject_ defined within the core module is augmented by an additional property using CityGML's _Application Domain Extension_ mechanism. Thus, the _Appearance_ module has a deliberate impact on all thematic extension modules.

| |

| *Modul name* | Bridge
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/bridge/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | bridge.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* .<| brid
| *Module description* | The _Bridge_ module allows the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of bridges, bridge parts, bridge installations, and interior bridge structures in four levels of detail (LOD 1 – 4).

| |

| *Module name* | Building
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/building/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | building.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | bldg
| *Module description* | The _Building_ module allows the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of buildings, building parts, building installations, and interior building structures in five levels of detail (LOD 0 – 4).

| |

| *Module name* | CityFurniture
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/cityfurniture/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | cityFurniture.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | frn
| *Module description* | The _CityFurniture_ module is used to represent city furniture objects in cities. City furniture objects are immovable objects like lanterns, traffic signs, advertising columns, benches, or bus stops that can be found in traffic areas, residential areas, on squares, or in built-up areas.

| |

| *Module name* | CityObjectGroup
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/cityobjectgroup/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | cityObjectGroup.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | grp
| *Module description* | The _CityObjectGroup_ module provides a grouping concept for CityGML. Arbitrary city objects may be aggregated in groups according to user-defined criteria to represent and transfer these aggregations as part of the city model. A group may be further classified by specific attributes.

| |

| *Module name* | Generics
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/generics/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | generics.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | gen
| *Module description* a| The _Generics_ module provides generic extensions to the CityGML data model that may be used to model and exchange additional attributes and features not covered by the predefined thematic classes of CityGML. However, generic extensions shall only be used if appropriate thematic classes or attributes are not provided by any other CityGML module

In order to represent generic attributes, the _Generics_ module augments the abstract base class __CityObject_ defined within the core module by an additional property using CityGML's _Application Domain Extension_ mechanism. Thus, the _Generics_ module has a deliberate impact on all thematic extension modules.

| |

| *Module name* | LandUse
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/landuse/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | landUse.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | luse
| *Module description* | The _LandUse_ module allows for the representation of areas of the earth's surface dedicated to a specific land use.

| |

| *Module name* | Relief
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/relief/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | relief.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | dem
| *Module description* | The _Relief_ module allows for the representation of the terrain in a city model. CityGML supports terrain representations in different levels of detail, reflecting different accuracies or resolutions. The terrain may be specified as a regular raster or grid, as a TIN, by break lines, and by mass points.

| |

| *Module name* | Transportation
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/transportation/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | transportation.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | tran
| *Module description* | The _Transportation_ module is used to represent the transportation features within a city, for example roads, tracks, railways, or squares. Transportation features may be represented as a linear network or by geometrically describing their 3D surfaces.

| |

| *Module Name* | Tunnel
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/tunnel/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | tunnel.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | tun
| *Module description* | The _Tunnel_ module facilitates the representation of thematic and spatial aspects of tunnels, tunnel parts, tunnel installations, and interior tunnel structures in four level of detail (LOD 1 – 4)

| |

| *Module name* | Vegetation
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/vegetation/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | vegetation.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | veg
| *Module description* | The _Vegetation_ module provides thematic classes to represent vegetation objects. CityGML's vegetation model distinguishes between solitary vegetation objects like trees, and vegetation areas which represent biotopes like forests or other plant communities.

| |

| *Module name* | WaterBody
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/waterbody/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | waterBody.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | wtr
| *Module description* | The _WaterBody_ module represents the thematic aspects and 3D geometry of rivers, canals, lakes, and basins. It does, however, not inherit any hydrological or other dynamic aspects so far.

| |

| *Module name* | TexturedSurface [deprecated]
| *XML namespace identifier* | http://www.opengis.net/citygml/texturedsurface/2.0
| *XML Schema file* | texturedSurface.xsd
| *Recommended namespace prefix* | tex
| *Module description* | The _TexturedSurface_ module allows for assigning visual appearance properties (color, shininess, transparency) and textures to 3D surfaces. Due to inherent limitations of its modelling approach this module has been marked deprecated and is expected to be removed in future CityGML versions. Appearance information provided by this module can be converted to CityGML's _Appearance_ module without information loss. Thus, the use of the _TexturedSurface_ module is _strongly discouraged_.

[[scls_7-2]]
=== CityGML profiles

A CityGML profile is a combination of thematic extension modules in conjunction with the core module of CityGML. Each CityGML instance document shall employ the CityGML profile appropriate to the provided data. In general, two approaches to employ a CityGML profile within an instance document can be differentiated:

. *CityGML profile definition embedded inline the CityGML instance document*
+
--
A CityGML profile can be bound to an instance document using the _schemaLocation_ attribute defined in the XML Schema instance namespace, http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance (commonly associated with the prefix _xsi_). The _xsi:schemaLocation_ attribute provides a way to locate the XML Schema definition for namespaces defined in an XML instance document. Its value is a whitespace-delimited list of pairs of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) where each pair consists of a namespace followed by the location of that namespace's XML Schema definition, which is typically a .xsd file.

By this means, the namespaces of the respective CityGML modules shall be defined within a CityGML instance document. The _xsi:schemaLocation_ attribute then shall be used to provide the location to the respective XML Schema definition of each module. All example instance documents given in <<annex_g>> follow this first approach.
--

. *CityGML profile definition provided by a separate XML Schema definition file*
+
--
The CityGML profile may also be specified by its own XML Schema file. This schema file shall combine the appropriate CityGML modules by importing the corresponding XML Schema definitions. For this purpose, the _import_ element defined in the XML Schema namespace shall be used, http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (commonly associated with the prefix _xs_). For the _xs:import_ element, the namespace of the imported CityGML module along with the location of the namespace's XML Schema definition have to be declared. In order to apply a CityGML profile to an instance document, the profile's schema has to be bound to the instance document using the _xsi:schemaLocation_ attribute. The XML Schema file of the CityGML profile shall not contain any further content.

The _targetNamespace_ of the profile's schema shall differ from the namespaces of the imported CityGML modules. The namespace associated with the profile should be in control of the originator of the instance document and must be given as a previously unused and globally unique URI. The profile's XML Schema file must be available (or accessible on the internet) to everybody parsing the associated CityGML instance document.
--

The second approach is illustrated by the following example XML Schema definition for the base profile of CityGML. Since the base profile is the union of all CityGML modules, the corresponding XML Schema definition imports each and every CityGML module. By this means, all components of the CityGML data model are available in and may be exchanged by instance documents referencing this example base profile. The schema definition file of the base profile is shipped with the CityGML schema package, and is accessible at http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/profiles/base/2.0/CityGML.xsd[http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/profiles/base/2.0/CityGML.xsd].

----

The following excerpt of a CityGML dataset exemplifies how to apply the base profile schema _CityGML.xsd_ to a CityGML instance document. The dataset contains two building objects and a city object group. The base profile defined by _CityGML.xsd_ is referenced using the _xsi:schemaLocation_ attribute of the root element. Thus, all CityGML modules are employed by the instance document and no further references to the XML Schema documents of the CityGML modules are necessary.
