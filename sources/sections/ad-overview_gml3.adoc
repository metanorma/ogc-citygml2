== Overview of employed GML3 geometry classes

[options="unnumbered,header"]
|===
| Abstract GML classes referenced in CityGML | GML subclass actually used in CityGML

| _Geometry |
| _Solid | Solid (boundary is restricted to OrientableSurfaces, TexturedSurfaces, Polygons or CompositeSurfaces)

| | CompositeSolid

| _Surface | Polygon (with holes, modelled by _Rings. The boundary is restricted to LineStrings or CompositeCurves)

| | OrientableSurface

| | TexturedSurface (defined in CityGML's _TexturedSurface_ module, not in GML. This modelling approach has been marked deprecated)

| | CompositeSurface (members are restricted to OrientableSurfaces, TexturedSurfaces, Polygons or CompositeSurfaces)

| | TriangulatedSurface

| | TIN

| _Curve | LineString

| | CompositeCurve (members are restricted to +
LineStrings or CompositeCurves)

| |

| | Point

| _Coverage | RectifiedGridCoverage

| |

| _AbstractGeometricAggregate | MultiSolid

| | MultiSurface (members are restricted to +
OrientableSurfaces, TexturedSurfaces, Polygons or CompositeSurfaces)

| | MultiCurve (members are restricted to LineStrings or CompositeCurves)

| | MultiPoint

| |

| | GeometricComplex (restricted to connected, linear networks)
